Interesting process for shuffling a dataset:

np.random.seed(0)
rand_split = np.random.rand(len(df))
train_list = rand_split < 0.8
val_list = (rand_split >= 0.8) & (rand_split < 0.9)
test_list = rand_split >= 0.9

 # This dataset will be used to train the model.
data_train = df[train_list]

# This dataset will be used to validate the model.
data_val = df[val_list]

# This dataset will be used to test the model.
data_test = df[test_list]
